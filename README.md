# Natural Language Processing

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** uses algorithms to understand and manipulate human language. This technology is one of the most broadly applied areas of machine learning. As AI continues to expand, so will the demand for professionals skilled at building models that analyze speech and language, uncover contextual patterns, and produce insights from text and audio.

By the end of this Specialization, you will be ready to design NLP applications that perform question-answering and sentiment analysis, create tools to translate languages and summarize text, and even build chatbots. These and other NLP applications are going to be at the forefront of the coming transformation to an [AI-powered future](https://bit.ly/3dRdU2m).

This Specialization is designed and taught by two experts in NLP, machine learning, and deep learning. [Younes Bensouda Mourri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/younes-bensouda-mourri-8749b9a9/) is an Instructor of AI at Stanford University who also helped build the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://bit.ly/3fexxkV). [Łukasz Kaiser](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukaszkaiser/) is a Staff Research Scientist at Google Brain and the co-author of Tensorflow, the Tensor2Tensor and Trax libraries, and the Transformer paper.

## Applied Learning Project
**This Specialization will equip you with the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques needed to build cutting-edge NLP systems:**

• Use logistic regression, naïve Bayes, and word vectors to implement sentiment analysis, complete analogies, and translate words, and use locality sensitive hashing for approximate nearest neighbors.

• Use dynamic programming, hidden Markov models, and word embeddings to autocorrect misspelled words, autocomplete partial sentences, and identify part-of-speech tags for words.

• Use dense and recurrent neural networks, LSTMs, GRUs, and Siamese networks in TensorFlow and Trax to perform advanced sentiment analysis, text generation, named entity recognition, and to identify duplicate questions.

• Use encoder-decoder, causal, and self-attention to perform advanced machine translation of complete sentences, text summarization, question-answering and to build chatbots. Models covered include T5, BERT, transformer, reformer, and more!

## Course 1: Classification and Vector Spaces in NLP
This is the first course of the Natural Language Processing Specialization.
- **Week 1:** *Logistic Regression for Sentiment Analysis of Tweets*
  
  Use a simple method to classify positive or negative sentiment in tweets

- **Week 2:** *Naïve Bayes for Sentiment Analysis of Tweets*

  Use a more advanced model for sentiment analysis

- **Week 3:** *Vector Space Models*

  Use vector space models to discover relationships between words and use principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the vector space and visualize those relationships

- **Week 4:** *Word Embeddings and Locality Sensitive Hashing for Machine Translation*

  Write a simple English-to-French translation algorithm using pre-computed word embeddings and locality sensitive hashing to relate words via approximate k-nearest neighbors search
